<h2><b>Part 1: How was the text selected?</b></h1>
<p>I selected the text Animal Farm by George Orwell for many reasons. </p>
<p>It is a novel that I really enjoy reading as it is filled with symbolism and striking one liners. </p>
<p>The story presents a parallel between the change in the name of the farm and with society in general.</p>
 <p>The paradoxical “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others” reveals the digression of fairness within the Animal Farm as the tale unfolds.</p>
<p> In today’s world, where everyone wishes to be accepted and be considered equal, I find this novel to mirror the attitude of different people. </p>
<p>Furthermore,  with significant events taking place in a fast paced narrative, I decided to map this novel.</p>
<h2><b>Part 2: How was the narrative reduced to events?</b> </h2>
<p>Having read the book many times, I knew the essence of each chapter. </p>
<p>I was able to pick out the significant details which would help retain the flow of the novel. </p>
<p>Also since this book had many events which triggered the subsequent actions, I was able to map them as an ‘event and its consequence.’</p>
<h2 style><b>Part 3: The process of map making</p></b> </h2>
<p>According to George Orwel, Animal Farm  reflected the events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror.</p>
<p>In order to translate that on to the map, I positioned the animal farm in in the city of Saint Petersburg where the Russian Revolution began.</p>
<p>I used a topographic map with layers that included World Hillshade, World Boundaries and Places in order to add another aesthetic dimension.</p>
<p>The events are mapped along the boundary to pictorially represent the paw of an animal. This symbolises the footsteps of change. </p>
